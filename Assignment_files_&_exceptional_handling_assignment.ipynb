        "\n",

        "                that is no longer in use, mainly when an object’s reference count reaches zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "              . This is done by the gc (garbage collector) module, which\n",

        "\n",

        "    - Exception handling in Python involves managing runtime errors  \n",
        "      (exceptions) in a way that allows the program to continue running without crashing. Python provides a robust way to handle errors using the try, except, else, and finally blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "       1. try Block\n",
        "\n",
        "          . The try block is where you place code that may raise an exception.\n",

        "       2. except Block\n",
        "\n",
        "          . The except block catches the exception raised in the try block.\n",

        "          . In I/O-bound programs (e.g., reading files, waiting for API\n",
        "            responses), CPU often waits for slow input/output.\n",
        "\n",
